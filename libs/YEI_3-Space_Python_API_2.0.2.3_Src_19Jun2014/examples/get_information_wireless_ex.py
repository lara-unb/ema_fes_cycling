## Communicating with a paired YEI 3-Space Sensor Wireless device and YEI

## If the COM port is not known or the device type is not known for the 3-Space
## Sensor device, we must do a search for the devices. We can do this by calling
## the getComPorts function which returns a lists of COM port information.
## (both known 3-Space Sensor devices and unknown devices)
## getComPorts also as a parameter called filter that takes a mask that denotes
## what type of 3-Space Sensor device can be found. If filter is not used or set
## to None all connected 3-Space Sensor devices and unknown devices are found.
## Each COM port information is a list containing
## (COM port name, friendly name, 3-Space Sensor device type)
## This example makes use of the filter parameter of getComPorts and just
## searches for Wireless devices and Dongle devices.

## take the first one from the list.

    ## TSWLSensor instance.

    ## Now we can start getting information from the Wireless device.
    ## The class instances have all of the functionality that corresponds to the
    ## 3-Space Sensor device type it is representing.
